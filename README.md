# BlueSCSI

BlueSCSI & ArdSCSino are hardware that reproduces SCSI devices (hard disks) with an Arduino STM32F103C (aka Blue Pill.)

`BlueSCSI` created by [erichelgeson](https://github.com/erichelgeson) is a fork of `ArdSCSino-stm32` which adds:
* Mac specific functionality
* Passive SCSI termination
* An alternative power source if not able to be powered by the SCSI bus

`ArdSCSino-stm32` created by [ztto](https://github.com/ztto/ArdSCSino-stm32) is the STM32 version of `ArdSCSino`
